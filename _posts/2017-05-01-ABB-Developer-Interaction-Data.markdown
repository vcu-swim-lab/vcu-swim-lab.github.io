A interaction dataset of 196 ABB developers using the Visual Studio IDE over a substantial period of time, consisting of clicks, keypresses, and IDE events has been posted <a href="https://abb-iss.github.io/DeveloperInteractionLogs/">at this link</a>. We have previously used this dataset for several studies of developer behavior, producing observations of developer debugging and feature location and several interpretable models able to extract high-level behaviors from the low level interaction data stream.
